What is information literacy?

The purpose of this opening chapter is to gain a better understanding of the term ‘information literacy’ by examining its origins, some definitions, and some models or standards of information literacy. This first chapter thus serves as a foundation for an evidence-based approach to teaching information literacy.

To understand the concept of information literacy, it is useful to begin by knowing the origin and literal meaning of the terms. The word information is from the Latin informatio, meaning concept or idea. The word literate is from the Latin literatus, meaning learned or lettered.

Over time, the definition of information literacy has changed. The traditional definition of literacy was the ability to read and write at a basic level and sign a document. More recently, the United States Workforce Investment Act of 19981 defined literacy as ‘an individual’s ability to read, write, speak in English, compute, and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job, in the family of the individual, and in society.’ As the world is moving from the information age to the digital age, new definitions of information literacy are evolving that include how to access information in digital formats and how to evaluate information and use it appropriately.

According to the American Library Association (ALA), information literacy is ‘increasingly important in the contemporary environment of rapid technological change and proliferating information resources’:

 Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.

 Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning and is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education.

Models of information literacy

To become information literate, one must understand the definition and context of information. One way to understand information and to put it in context is to visualize it as part of the DIKW hierarchy or pyramid: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (see Figure 1.13).

According to the KIT Institute in the Netherlands:

 Data are raw statistics and facts.

 Information comprises the basic facts with context and perspective.  Knowledge is information which provides guidance for action.

 Wisdom is understanding which knowledge to use for what purpose.4

The DIKW hierarchy puts the concept of information into context. That is, there must be an understanding of data or facts for those data to become information and some understanding of information patterns for information to become knowledge.

According to Cleveland,5 the origin of the DIKW hierarchy is a poem by T.S. Eliot in 1934 entitled ‘The Rock’:

Where is the Life we have lost in living?

Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?6

Practical models

The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) defines an information literate individual as one possessing particular skill sets and who is able to:

 determine the extent of information needed;

 access the needed information effectively and efficiently;

 evaluate information and its sources critically;

 incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base;

 use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose;

 understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally.7

Information literacy may be considered a new liberal art

... that extends from knowing how to use computers and access information to critical reflection on the nature of information itself, its technical infrastructure, and its social, cultural and even philosophical context and impact – as essential to the mental framework of the educated information-age citizen as the trivium of basic liberal arts (grammar, logic and rhetoric) was to the educated person in medieval society.8

The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) maintains that as society and technology changes, the standards of information literacy change. According to NCTE, ‘because technology has increased the intensity and complexity of literate environments, the twenty-first century demands that a literate person possess a wide range of abilities and competencies, many literacies.’9

The literacies listed by NCTE include the ability to:

 develop proficiency with the tools of technology;

 build relationships with others to pose and solve problems collaboratively and cross-culturally;

 design and share information for global communities to meet a variety of purposes;

 manage, analyze, and synthesize multiple streams of simultaneous information;

 create, critique, analyze, and evaluate multimedia texts;

 attend to the ethical responsibilities required by these complex

environments.10

In a similar model, the California Commission on Learning Resources breaks down information literacy as a fusion or integration of several discrete components that will be addressed in this text: library literacy, computer literacy, media literacy, technological literacy, ethics, critical thinking, and communication skills.11

International models

Information literacy is a global concern and effort. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) reports on international efforts promoting information literacy by country or region: Australia, Francophone regions, Latin America, Nordic countries, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sub-Saharan Africa, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the United States and Canada, and South Africa. The goal of their report, ‘Information Literacy: An International State-of-the-Art,’12 is to identify worldwide trends in information literacy, including: educational resources, information literacy-related publications, information literacy organizations, opportunities for training for information literacy professionals, and conferences and meetings related to information literacy.

The International Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Literacy Panel has identified four major literacies:

Access: Manage/Integrate:

Evaluate: Create:

the ability to retrieve information efficiently and effectively.

the ability to organize information in a logical and coherent manner and to interpret, summarize, paraphrase, and use information appropriately.

the ability to access the quality of the information being presented and its relevance to one’s needs.

the ability to create new information based on the appropriate information resources previously retrieved.13

The five basic tasks of a virtual scholar identified by UKOLN (UK Office of Libraries and Networking) are:

Discover: awareness of resources that address a particular information need.

Locate: ability to find these resources quickly.

Request: Access: Use:

knowledge of the process to obtain the information.

ability to obtain the full text of the needed information.

ability to meet one’s needs by applying the information retrieved to produce new knowledge.14

Information competency

The definitions of information competency typically include competency in accessing information in electronic formats.

The Work Group on Information Competence, the Commission on Learning Resources and Instructional Technology (CLRIT), and the California State University (CSU) system define information competence as ‘the ability to find, evaluate, use, and communicate information in all of its various formats.’15

The Secretary’s Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) report What Work Requires of Schools defines information competence as the ability to: (1) acquire and evaluate information; (2) organize and maintain information; (3) interpret and communicate information; and (4) use computers to process information.16

What does research indicate about information literacy?

Indications of research on information literacy

The greatest lack of information literacy in teens is in the evaluation of information resources and in the knowledge and use of Boolean operators. The ‘Information Literacy Assessment Trial Study of Students in the Eleventh Grade in Mississippi’, a 2007 specialist project by Boswell,17 found that most students scored lowest in these two areas.

Information literacy is a skill set that can be taught. An ‘Information Competency Assessment Instrument’ (see Appendix 1), developed by Marshall in 200218 and used as a pre- and post-test for an undergraduate information literacy course at the University of Southern Mississippi, indicated a measurable improvement in the evaluation of information and information sources.19

Research on the Google Generation (defined as those born after 1993) conducted by CIBER (Centre for Information Behaviour and Evaluation of Research at University College London) indicates that while the perception is that teens are very techno-savvy, they tend to be shallow in their information-seeking behaviour:

 Online searching by teens tends to be shallow information-skimming, not in-depth searching.

 Sixty percent visit a site once only and view each web page only for a few seconds.20

Librarians are usually the persons who teach information literacy skills and recent studies indicate a positive correlation between having a professional, certified school librarian and student achievement (see Appendix 3).21

Indications of research on the virtual scholar

A longitudinal survey of scientists, engineers, and social scientists from 1977 to the present (Tenopir and King, 2000; Tenopir, 2008) indicates that scholars:

 read an increasing number of scholarly articles in not much more time;

 use an increasing number of ways and sources to locate scholarly articles;

 read electronic and print materials;

 read a higher percentage of older articles now than in previous years.22

According to Tenopir and King (2000) and Tenopir (2008),23 the trend for scholarly publishing is granularity – that is, being able to find a particular element of a scholarly article such as a graph of raw data or a particular paragraph of interest. Another trend is that an increasing number of interdisciplinary sources are read by scholars and researchers. Older scholars are more likely to read both print and electronic resources, while younger scholars tend to read more electronic resources.

A study of scholarly activity online by CIBER indicates that access drives use: there is a tremendous use of the scholarly net and about half of the visitors to scholarly websites are robots.

CIBER (Nicholas, 2008) found that human information-seeking behavior tends to be:

 promiscuous: 40–50 percent of persons visiting a site do not return;

 bouncing: half of website visitors view only 1–3 pages and bounce in and out (scholars bounce less, Google searchers and younger searchers bounce more);

 flicking: many users channel hop (a checking form of behavior; some bouncing is attributed to flicking);

 viewing: humans do not view an online article longer than 3 minutes, spend more time reading short articles than long ones, or read the abstract and squirrel away the article. Two-thirds of downloads are never read.24

Scholarly information-seeking behavior includes power-browsing, where the horizontal replaces the vertical such as scanning three or four books in 15 minutes. Navigation in cyberspace takes up a great deal of time. People spend about half their time viewing content and the other half navigating.25

Why is it important to be information literate?

With the rapid technological advances in society today and increased access to said technology by people around the world, becoming information literate is of the utmost importance (see Appendix 4).26 Globalization, which may be defined as ‘a movement of economic integration, of cultural homogenization, and of technological uniformization’ (Finger, 2005: 269), is, therefore, a major reason to be information literate.27 Thus, even though it has been traditionally associated with economics, globalization has become so much more. Brysk (2002) maintains that it is a combination of the following four elements:

 Connection – increased amount of interaction and transactions of goods, services, and information from country to country.

 Cosmopolitanism – increased number of centers of power and influence worldwide.

 Communication – technological advances which have greatly increased international business ventures, economic opportunities, and the transaction of different ideas and values.

 Commodification – the expansion of world markets and the increased opportunities to people worldwide.28

Thomas Friedman (2005) identifies the following world ‘flatteners:’ the fall of the Berlin Wall, fiber-optic cable and the ‘dot-com’ boom, the increase in common software programs and open-source materials, and the increase in the amount of outsourcing by corporations worldwide. He contends that these flatteners ‘converged around the year 2000 [to] create a flat world: a global, Web-enabled platform for sharing knowledge and work, irrespective of time, distance, geography, and increasingly, language.’29 This has greatly increased employment opportunities for people worldwide – people from countries where such opportunities were previously unheard of. Thus if one is not aware of or does not possess the skills to access information quickly, to evaluate this information, and to use this information to create new products and materials, he/she may lose out on valuable economic and social opportunities. To remain competitive in an international market, then, it is imperative to be information literate.30
