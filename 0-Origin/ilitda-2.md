Cultural literacy

We have ignored cultural literacy in thinking about education ... Cultural literacy is the oxygen of social intercourse. (E.D. Hirsch)1

What is culture?

The word ‘culture’ is from the Latin word cultura, which means ‘cultivation.’

Culture is defined by the Geography Glossary (1999)2 as ‘the accumulated habits, attitudes, and beliefs of a group of people that define for them their general behavior and way of life; the total set of learned activities of a people.’

The US National Park Service defines culture as an archaeological term: ‘Common beliefs and practices of a group of people ... the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon man’s capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations.’3

Why is cultural literacy important?

Understanding both one’s own and other cultures can help a person:

 relate to their surroundings;  relate to their own culture;  relate to other cultures;

 gain a broader worldview.

Cultures, while founded upon a set of basic ideas and shared history and heritage, are constantly changing and evolving. To make things more complicated, subcultures arise within main cultures. Keeping up with all the cultures and subcultures in the world is a monumental task, and nearly impossible for an individual to do. It is more realistic to focus on learning the basic traits of large, main cultures and then research for more detail on specific cultures or subcultures as one’s worldview broadens.

How does one become culturally literate?

Cognitive scientists use the term ‘schemas’ to describe the mental units into which humans organize knowledge. According to Hirsch’s interpretation of schema theory,4 as humans gain knowledge, they create new schemas and connect them to pre-existing schemas.

Shared knowledge or schemas play an important role in cultural literacy and there are several ways one can increase cultural literacy:

 keep track of current events – local, national, and global;

 be aware of the current trends in technology, entertainment, and literature;

 take the time to read or research about cultures with which one is unfamiliar.

Given the importance of global literacy in a technology-driven world, Robert Rosen, CEO of Healthy Companies International in Washington and the author of Global Literacies: Lessons on Business Leadership and National Cultures (2000),5 recommends the following:

 Use technology in globally literate ways. In a global marketplace, technology is the medium through which people conduct business. While technology accelerates and expands the pace and range of communication, it also increases the chances for miscommunication. Especially with technology through which you can’t pick up on physical or emotional cues, you must read between the lines and listen deeply for the emotion, tone, context, and cultural nuances in every communication.

 Learn from the best around the world. Each part of the world excels in a different literacy area. Some Asian cultures, for example, teach us about personal literacy through their ability to understand paradox and ambiguity. Latin American cultures teach us about social literacy by modeling how to build relationships in less organized, constantly changing environments. From European cultures, we learn cultural literacy based on centuries of working and living cross-culturally. In North America, we learn business literacy by building change- ready, technology-savvy, high-performance organizations in a results- oriented culture.

 Use culture as a tool for business success. It’s vital to understand how your culture influences how you relate to technology. Americans love new technology; they like quick action and excel at creating new things. They tend to abandon ideas that don’t show a rapid return on investment. Other cultures react differently. The Japanese, for example, have been more comfortable with incremental improvements.

According to Rubin, adopting these strategies can start one on a path to global literacy. It is a long-term process, and the choice is up to the individual: one can choose to get started, or choose to be left behind.

How can one increase awareness of one’s own history and culture?

Many believe that cultural literacy begins with an awareness of one’s own history and culture. For instance, it is useful to know the history and culture related to family ancestry:

 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has an extensive collection of genealogy records from around the world. These records are accessible online through their FamilySearch.org website.

 CensusFinder.com is a web portal to census information in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada as well as Native American sources.

One unique way to discover one’s ancestry is to find one’s origins through DNA testing:

 The Genographic Project by National Geographic maps individual deep origins through DNA testing. For a fee, a DNA test kit will be sent, the DNA analyzed, and a map tracing a person’s ancient origins will be returned. As more people participate in this global project, the human genetic journey will be more fully mapped and understood (https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html).

 Genetic Genealogy also uses DNA testing to trace one’s deep ancestral roots (http://www.dnaancestryproject.com/).

 AfricanAncestry.com is a DNA-testing project for those with African roots.

To understand an individual’s context within the world, it is useful to be knowledgeable about the geographic places of origin – one’s own state, province, region, and country:

 For information about each of the 50 states in the United States, visit the History Channel website, The States (http://www.history.com/ states.do).

 The BBC has a useful profile on the United Kingdom as well as other countries (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/ 1038758.stm).

 The CIA World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/ the-world-factbook/countrylisting.html) is a good resource for geographic and statistical information for each country.

After learning about one’s own geographic location, it is useful to research other places of interest. According to William Faulkner (1897–1962), ‘To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.’ To learn some interesting facts about Faulkner’s unique but little-known state of Mississippi, visit the site Mississippi ... Believe It (http://www.mississippibelieveit.com/). To find out more about Faulkner, visit the Faulkner site at the University of Mississippi (http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/faulkner.html).

Take a real or virtual tour of a museum or cultural exhibit such as those in the WWW Virtual Library site, ‘Museums of the World’ (http:// icom.museum/vlmp/world.html).

Origins of culture: oral tradition

Culture, the shared beliefs and practices of a people, is passed down from generation to generation. How was this information collected, stored, and retrieved before writing? It was collected and stored in the human brain and passed down by oral tradition. Scholars believe that memorization and recitation of human knowledge in pre-literate societies was enhanced by the use of mnemonic devices such as images, knots or beads, song or rhythm.

 Stone Age pictographs/pictures, such as those on the cave walls at Lascaux, France6 (about 40,000 BC), were of animals and/or humans and may be related to storytelling or the passing down of hunting knowledge, tribal legends, or lore.

 The ancient Incas of Peru used a system of different knots in various colored and sized cords to record, store, and transmit information. Quipus7 could only be interpreted by trained ‘rememberers’ whose knowledge has since been lost.

 The Iliad and the Odyssey are two epic stories about the last days and aftermath of the Greek/Trojan War of about 1,200 BC. The 16,000 lines of the Iliad and the 13,000 lines of the Odyssey, attributed to the blind bard Homer,8 were passed down through oral tradition during centuries of illiteracy and not written down until about 800 BC. These tales were thought to be pure fiction until the late 1800s when German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann uncovered the ancient city of Troy near the coast of Turkey by following Homer’s literal description.9

‘For 3,000 years, tales of Troy and its heroes – Achilles and Hector, Paris and the legendary beauty Helen – have fired the human imagination.’10 With In Search of the Trojan War (1998), Michael Wood brings vividly to life the legend and lore of the Heroic Age in an archaeological adventure that sifts through the myths and speculation to provide a privileged view of the riches and the reality of ancient Troy. Wood, who based his book on the BBC television series of the same name,11 concludes that Mycenae and other Greek kingdoms did in fact destroy the Anatolian city of Troy at Hissarlik at the end of the Bronze Age, between 1,375 and 1,250 BC. According to the publisher’s synopsis, the book is ‘devoted to archeological efforts to prove the truth of Homer’s epic and confirm that Troy was actually at Hissarlik. Wood also describes the history and archeology of Mycenae, where in the 1870s Heinrich Schliemann found ruins supporting Homer’s description of Agamemnon’s empire, Knossos and other ancient sites.’

 The author Alex Haley spent his boyhood summers in rural Tennessee listening to his grandmother and great-aunts recount tales about their family that had been handed down to them since the days of slavery. In the process of researching his family’s history, which evolved into the book and mini-series Roots: The Saga of an American Family (1976),12 he traveled to the village of his ancestors in Africa and heard the griote,13 or tribal historian, recite the village history back in time. Haley recalled that his hair stood on end when the griote recounted that Kunta Kente (Haley’s ancestor who was captured and sold into slavery) went hunting one day and did not return.14

Pictographs and ideographs

In ancient times, pictures served as mnemonic devices to help recall data and this early use of visualization led to the development of systems of symbolic pictographs and ideographs, the precursors of alphabets.

Pre-historic pictographs, literally ‘picture writing,’ date back to the Stone Age and, as far as is known, represent concrete objects. A related term, petroglyphs, refers to images etched in stone.15

Ideographs (pictures representing ideas) originated about 5,000 BC in Sumeria on clay tablets and about 4,000 BC in Egypt on papyrus.16

Early alphabets

Sumerian

Cuneiform, from the Latin cuneus or wedge, attributes its distinctive shape to the use of a wedge-shaped reed stylus to press symbols into damp clay tablets.

Cuneiform script first arose in the Tigris–Euphrates region of the Middle East (land of the Sumerians, Elamites, Akkadians, Assyrians, Hittites, Chaldeans, and Babylonians), a land known as Mesopotamia, ‘land between the rivers.’

As city-states first arose in this region, a system of cylinder seals17 to indicate ownership and pictograms to record commercial transactions developed. Over time, these symbols became more abstract and by c.3,000 BC had evolved into a phonetic cuneiform script.18

Egyptian

Thoth, who later became the ibis-headed god of scribes, is credited as the inventor of writing in Egypt. It was said that instead of being pleased, Pharaoh proclaimed this new invention would cause men’s minds to grow lazy.

Egyptians called their writing medju-netjer, ‘words of the gods,’ and the Greeks later named the script, hieroglyphica, or ‘sacred letters.’ The earliest Egyptian glyphs,19 recently discovered in the pre-dynastic tomb of Scorpion I at Abydos, have been dated to c.3,400–3,200 BC (yes, there really was a Scorpion King and his mace head is on exhibit at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, UK).20

Some of the oldest hieroglyphic writings in Egypt are passages from The Book of the Dead,21 a compilation of burial rites, instructions, and guidance in preparation for death and the afterlife. While the oldest of these religious hieroglyphs are inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, there is some evidence that as early as c.2,400 BC, priest scribes in Annu were producing editions on papyri.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were reserved for religious texts, and a shorthand, hieratic script was used for more common purposes. Around the seventh century BC, the writing evolved into an even simpler demotic script and the ability to translate hieroglyphs was eventually lost. In 1799, the French discovered the Rosetta Stone inscribed in three different scripts: Egyptian hieroglyphic, Egyptian demotic, and Greek. The Rosetta Stone (on display in the Egyptian Hall of the British Museum) was key to the deciphering of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.22

Greco-Roman alphabet

The knowledge of early Greek alphabets, known as Linear A and Linear B, disappeared during the Greek Dark Ages. During the Archaic Period, the Greeks adopted and adapted the Phoenician alphabet to their language.

The alphabet (named after the first two letters, alpha and beta) originated in the Middle East about 3,600 years ago, and was known as the North Semitic alphabet. The names given to the phonetic symbols were the same as those of the objects on which they were based.

The first symbol aleph originally represented the head of an ox. Aleph developed into the Greek letter alpha, which later became our letter A.

The second symbol beth originally represented a house. Beth developed into the Greek beta, and later our letter B.

The North Semitic alphabet had two offshoots:

 Aramaic, which later developed into Hebrew and Arabic;

 Caananite, which was adopted by the Phoenicians.

The Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet and added vowels.

The Romans modified the Greek alphabet into the one we use today. The Latin language also absorbed most of the Greek language. Today,

about half of the English language has Greco-Roman roots.

The ancient Greek language is richer, more complex, and more precise than modern languages, and even the modern Koine (common) Greek is a much simplified version of Classical Greek. For many centuries, Classical Greek was the language of scholars and scientists and was a requirement, along with Latin, for higher education:

 ‘I have become convinced that of all that human language has produced truly and simply beautiful, I knew nothing before I learned Greek ... Without a knowledge of Greek there is no education.’ (Leo Tolstoy)

 Learn Greek; it is the language of wisdom.’ (George Bernard Shaw)

 ‘I would make everyone learn English; then I would let the clever ones learn Latin as an honour and Greek as a treat.’ (Sir Winston Churchill)
