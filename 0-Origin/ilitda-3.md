Library literacy: history, types, and roles

Libraries are the memories of mankind. (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

Early libraries

To understand what a library is, it is useful to know the history of libraries, how they developed over time, and what traditions of the early libraries continue in modern libraries. The word library is from the Latin liber, meaning ‘book,’ and a library has traditionally meant a collection of books.

The related term archive is from the Greek archeia, or place of archeion, a public office. The origin of the root word indicates it was originally a storehouse of government records. The Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS)1 defines archive as a storage facility that preserves historical, informational, legal, or evidential records. The earliest physical repositories discovered so far date to about 3,000 BC in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and Egypt and were associated with royal palaces and temples.

Babylonian

Cuneiform schools and libraries

The development of cuneiform script was accompanied by the founding of schools and libraries. A large cache of school tablets (dated to c.2,500 BC) unearthed in the ancient city of Shuruppak revealed that Sumerian schoolteachers were the first-known compilers of dictionaries (Sumero- Akkadian dictionaries signify a mingling of the two cultures).

The headmaster (‘father of the school’), called ummia or ‘teacher,’ ruled over his students (‘sons of the school’) with the threat of corporal punishment for mistakes or laziness. Among the firsts listed by Kramer in History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine ‘Firsts’ in Recorded History (1988) are the first schools, the first pharmacopoeia, and the first library catalog.2

Houses of tablets

Excavations in the ancient city of Nippur have uncovered libraries known as ‘Houses of Tablets’ with thousands of Sumerian and Akkadian inscribed tablets of administrative, legal, medical, and business records, religious and astronomical texts, and the oldest known versions (late third millennium) of literary works:

 Epic of Gilgamesh, the account of the quest of a hero for the secret of immortality. Gilgamesh (ruler of Uruk c.2,700 BC) obtains the key to immortality only to have it stolen by a serpent. The Gilgamesh story is known as ‘the Sumerian Noah’ due to its reference to the survivor of a great flood.3

 Enuma Elish, or ‘When on high,’ the Sumerian account of creation, was recited annually during the New Year Celebration, probably from atop the ziggurat (temple).4

Hammurabi, ruler of Babylon (1,792–1,750 BC) amassed a large collection of clay tablets containing hymns, divination texts (reading the future from the entrails of animals), mathematical texts, and myths. Hammurabi is most notable for writing the oldest inscribed law code found thus far, The Code of Hammurabi:

 to cause justice to prevail in the country;  to destroy the wicked and the evil;

 that the strong may not oppress the weak.

The Code of Hammurabi is engraved on a basalt stele and is on display at the Louvre in Paris.5

First librarian

Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria in the seventh century BC, is considered by historians to be the first great librarian. His House of Tablets was divided into two sections: one, an archive of government documents, business records, and correspondence; the other, a collection of literature and scholarly works of history, religion, science, mathematics, astrology, and medicine. The collection of more than 25,000 tablets was arranged by subject.

Ashurbanipal sent agents to search the empire for scholarly works and literature to be copied and annotated by his royal scribes. This is believed to be the first attempt to create a great universal library and was said to be the inspiration for Alexander’s Great Library.

Of his great library at Ninevah, Ashurbanipal stated:

I obtained the hidden treasures of the sum of the scribes’ knowledge ... I have read the artistic script of the Sumerians and the obscure script of the Akkadians and I have deciphered the inscriptions that were carved in the rock some time before the Flood.6

Egyptian

Egyptian houses of writings

Egypt is credited with the invention of books in the form of papyrus, a lightweight writing material later adopted by the Greeks and Romans. Papyrus reeds that grew plentifully along the Nile were processed into sheets and rolled into scrolls. The earliest fragment of papyrus (from which our word paper is derived) dates to c.3,000 BC and the oldest papyrus with hieroglyphic text to c.2,400 BC.

One of the earliest historical references to an Egyptian library, c.2,470 BC, was a tomb inscription that referred to the owner as a ‘Scribe in the House of Books.’ In the fourth and fifth dynasties (c.2,600–2,300 BC), Egypt had at least three royal ‘Houses of Writings,’ which held archives, tax records, and religious texts, and there is some evidence to support Egyptian libraries as far back as 3,000 BC.

King Ramses II (1,300 BC) had a large library of over 20,000 papyrus scrolls containing works of history, science, and literature. Popular literature of the time included such tales as ‘Story of the Eloquent Peasant,’ ‘Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor,’ and ‘Tale of Two Brothers.’7

Egyptian literature

One of the most popular stories, dating back to c.2,000 BC was ‘The Story of Sinuhe’ (called the Egyptian Moses). (An interesting note is that ‘The Story of Sinuhe’ was adapted by Hollywood for the epic The Egyptian (1954).8)

Greek

Classical periods

Much of the traditions and culture of Western civilization may be traced back to the Greeks – many scholars believe that even the Renaissance was influenced by the rediscovery of Greek logic and literature.

The Classical Greek period was an era of widespread literacy and intense interest in art and architecture, science, mathematics, music, history, athletics, philosophy, theater, and literature.

There is evidence of public libraries in Greece around the sixth century BC, in addition to the private collections of scholars and playwrights.

 Pisistratus, ruler of Athens, founded what Aulus Gellius calls ‘the first public library’ in 560 BC.9

 About the same time, Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, founded a public library on the island.10

Bookshops and scriptoria (where clerks copied works of literature on commission) were common in Classical Athens, particularly in the agora, or public marketplace.

 In The Birds (414 BC), Aristophanes portrayed Athenians as voracious readers who rushed out to the bookshops each morning to browse and chat with their friends.

 In The Frogs, one of Aristophanes’ characters comments, ‘You must be very unobservant, or very uneducated; you don’t even know your Aesop.’

Private literary collections became status symbols of the literati: Nicocrates of Cyprus, Euclid the Archon, Euripides, Euthydemus, and Aristotle.

Greek education reflected their ideals of ‘a sound mind in a sound body’ (a balance of mental and physical fitness) and ‘know thyself’ (logic and self-reflection). While girls were educated at home, usually by slaves, boys were educated more formally in gymnasia, where they were trained in athletics and taught Homer and Aesop as well as the seven liberal arts:

 Trivium: grammar, rhetoric, logic;

 Quadrivium: geometry, arithmetic, music, astronomy.

These subjects were called the liberal arts from the root word of liberty, liber, reflecting the Greeks’ view that a free, democratic society (which to them meant freeborn male citizens) depended on a literate populace.

Hellenistic period

When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left a vast empire that was apportioned to his three generals. The general Ptolemy took control of Egypt, founding the last Egyptian dynasty.

In 295 BC, Pharoah Ptolemy I Sotor established the Great Library of Alexandria, Egypt. At the adjoining Museion, scholars made notable advances in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, geometry, applied science, and medicine, taking advantage of the observatory, zoo, and botanical gardens in the grounds.

 Zenodotus was the first librarian at the Great Library of Alexandria and the first known to put lists in alphabetical order.

 Ptolemy II Philadelphus collected scrolls from all parts of Greece and Asia. Resident scholars wrote, translated foreign works, and gathered compilations of other manuscripts. Officials traveled through the region, purchasing entire collections for the library.

 Callimachus compiled the first bibliography of Greek literature, Pinakes, or Tables (120 volumes).11

Ptolemy III Euergetes asked world leaders to lend him their scrolls and even ordered a search of all ships for scrolls. These scrolls would be confiscated and replaced by copies.

Every known scholarly work of the ancient world was collected and translated into Greek. Considered to be the greatest library of the ancient world (500,000–700,000 scrolls), it was destroyed by a series of fires, the first of which occurred in 47 BC during Caesar’s invasion of Cleopatra’s Egypt.12

The Great Library at Alexandria was the second known attempt to establish a universal library (Ashurbanipal’s Great Library at Ninevah being the first). The scholar Leibnitz revived this idea during the Renaissance.

In modern times, the largest and most comprehensive libraries are the US Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) and the British Library (http://www.bl.uk/), with many millions of items – books, manuscripts (handwritten books), incunabula (early printed books), photographs, recordings, and maps.

Today, the Egyptian government is trying to restore the former glory of the great library, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.13

Selected Greek glossary

Arete: Virtue, excellence, goodness.

Bibliotheke: Bookcase; later came to mean a library.

Gymnasium: Literally ‘to exercise naked,’ a school for boys to physically

exercise, as well as be taught the seven liberal arts.

Lyceum: Covered walk next to the Temple of Apollo the Wolf Slayer

where Aristotle taught philosophy. Later came to mean a school. Museion: Temple of the Muses; museum.

Classical Rome

According to the Roman poet Horace, ‘Greece has conquered her rude conqueror,’ meaning that, although the Romans conquered Greece, they admired and absorbed Greek language, literature, art, and culture.

 The first Roman libraries were private collections plundered from the Greeks as spoils of war.

 There is a record of Roman bookshops, taberna libraria, in the Forum, or public marketplace.

 As with the Greeks, private libraries were usually specialized collections.14

 Excavations at the Villa of Papyri at Herculaneum (a seaside resort near Pompeii) revealed a private library of about 1,800 scrolls, primarily the works of the philosopher Philodemus.15

Rome carried on the Greek tradition of public libraries:

 The first public library in Rome was planned by Julius Caesar and

built by Asinius Pollio c.39 BC on the Palatine Hill.

 Julius Caesar’s concept of adjoining ‘sister’ Latin and Greek libraries, Bybliotheka Latina Apollinis and Bybliotheca Graeca Apollinis, was planned by the Roman scholar Varro who had written De Bibliothecis (On Libraries).16

The first Roman Emperor, Augustus, established a public library in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, and another, the Bibliotheca Octaviana, in the Porticus Octavia.

The Emperor Vespasian founded the Bibliotheca Pacis (Library of Peace) in the Temple of Peace; the library was dedicated in AD 75 and considered by Pliny to be one of the three most beautiful buildings in Rome. The greatest imperial library was built in the Forum of Trajan by the Emperor Trajan. The two libraries of the Bibliotheca Ulpia, founded in AD 114, faced one another across a courtyard, the Latin collection on the west and the Greek on the east.17

The Romans made some unique contributions to librarianship:

 Trajan was the earliest known Roman emperor to build a bath-house library. Other notable public baths or thermae include the Baths of Caracalla and the Baths of Diocletian, which could hold up to 6,000 bathers.18

 Roman libraries were spacious rooms lined with wall niches that held numbered wooden bookcases, armaria, leaving space in the center of the room for reading tables and chairs. Those in charge of the libraries were called librarii a bibliotheca, or librarians.19

 By c. AD 150, the Romans were replacing papyrus scrolls with codices, early books of parchment or vellum sheets (made from animal skins) laced together accordian-style, with wood or leather covers. The codex had several advantages over scrolls: they were more portable and easier to reference, store, and read.

To understand the influence of Rome on Western culture, even before the Christian era, one must be aware of the history of Roman Britain. Britannia was a Roman province for almost 400 years and its major town was Londinium (present-day London). More about historic Roman London can be found at the Museum of London (http://www .museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Prehistoric1700/Roman.htm).

Bath in England was once the Roman town known as Aquae Sulis (‘Waters of Sul’ or ‘Minerva’), named after a sacred, hot spring (http:// www.romanbaths.co.uk/).

Latin literature and language

 One of the most important works of Latin literature was The Aeneid (19 BC), the tale of Aeneas, who escaped death when Troy fell to the Greeks. According to the epic, Aeneas, along with his son and elderly father, emigrated to Italy and founded the Roman race whose destiny was to rule the world in peace and prosperity (Pax Romana).

 Virgil was commissioned to write The Aeneid by the Emperor Augustus to glorify Rome through a Homeric-style epic that celebrated the mythical founding and destiny of the Roman Empire.

 The poet Horace’s most famous works, Odes (23 BC), praised the simple life of the Roman countryside.

 Livy, a Roman historian, wrote the 142 volume Ab Urbe Condita (From the Founding of the City) (begun in 29 BC).

 Suetonius, a biographer, historian, and author of Lives of the Twelve Caesars (c. AD 121), served as imperial librarian under Hadrian. The BBC mini-series, I, Claudius was largely based on the works of Suetonius.20

Medieval scriptorium

Medieval is Latin for Middle Ages, so called because it is the period between the ancient and modern worlds. It is generally dated from the fall of Rome in 476 AD until the Renaissance.

In the Islamic East, literature and libraries flourished, but in the West, the Medieval or Middle Ages are also known as the Dark Ages because of widespread illiteracy. During this time Holy Scriptures, as well as classical literature and scholarly works, were preserved and copied in monastic scriptoria. Scriptoria is the plural form of scriptorium, which is a room in a monastery set aside for the copying, writing, or illumination of manuscripts and records.

Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco is a murder mystery set in a medieval monastery and scriptorium where monks laboriously copied texts by hand on parchment or vellum. Name of the Rose, a 1986 movie based on the book, starred Sean Connery, Christian Slater, and F. Murray Abraham.21

Since most medieval Europeans were illiterate, alternative methods were used to teach the Bible: Gothic cathedrals, such as Canterbury Cathedral (http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/), were constructed with biblical stories illustrated in sculpture and stained glass and biblical Miracle or Mystery Plays were enacted.22

Beowulf (http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~beowulf/) is an epic tale dated to 1000 AD. A modern retelling of Beowulf was published by Michael Crichton as Eaters of the Dead (1976). A movie based on the book and starring Antonio Banderas was called The 13th Warrior.23 A computer-enhanced version of Beowulf was released in 2007.24

Types of libraries

School libraries

School libraries contain materials that support the school’s curriculum. One interesting example of a large free public school for children during the Victorian era was the Ragged School in London (http://

www.raggedschoolmuseum.org.uk/nextgen/history/schoolhistory.shtml). Public libraries

Public libraries contain materials that support general research, recreational reading, community information needs, and local history. The first public library since ancient times (with a small subscription fee) was the Library Company of Philadelphia, established by Benjamin Franklin in 1731.25

One great champion of public libraries was Andrew Carnegie, who funded the building of more than 2,500 public libraries in the English- speaking world. The first Carnegie Library is in his birthplace, Dunfermline, Scotland,26 and the first Carnegie Library in the States is in his adopted hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (http://www.clpgh.org/).

Academic libraries

Academic libraries contain materials that support both general research and the specific programs and degrees offered at the institution. The first great university and academic library in the Western world is the University of Bologna, Italy.27 The University of Oxford, the first great English university with the oldest English-language library, the Bodleian, was based on the Bologna University model.28 The first university library in the US was the Harvard University Library, founded in 1638.29

Archives and special collections

Archives and special collections contain materials that are being collected for long-term preservation. Examples include the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA: http://www.archives .gov/), the British National Archives (http://www.nationalarchives .gov.uk/), and the Folger Shakespeare Library (http://www.folger.edu/) in Washington, DC.

Special libraries

Special libraries contain materials that are very specific to the needs of the institution. These are generally not open to the public and include libraries in corporations and institutions such as prisons and hospitals (see the Special Libraries Association at http://www.sla.org/).

National libraries

The British Museum Library was established in 1753 when Sir Hans Sloan bequeathed his large collection of books and manuscripts to the nation. In 1973, the British Library (http://www.bl.uk/) was founded as a separate institution and is now housed in a modern building near King’s Cross/St Pancras Station.

The Bibliothèque Nationale of France (http://www.bnf.fr/), originally the Royal Library founded by Charles V in the fourteenth century, was established in 1789 after the French Revolution as the National Library of the French people.

The US National Library, the Library of Congress (http://www .loc.gov/), was established in 1800 as a reference library for Congress. Thomas Jefferson sold his large and valuable book collection to the Library of Congress in 1814, more than doubling the collection.30

Roles of libraries

What is the role of the library in a democratic society?  To collect and preserve information.

 To provide access to information. Why is that important?

 If information is not preserved, it is lost.

 The old adage is true – knowledge is power and information is the means to succeed. Democracy is based on freedom and equality, and when access to information is limited or denied according to one individual’s or group’s beliefs, the rest of society, including future generations, may suffer.

Libraries provide access to information:

 by organizing information – by creating, improving on, and implementing classification schemes and cataloging tools, librarians organize information so that specific items can be located;

 by selecting, purchasing, and maintaining materials so that they are accessible to others.
