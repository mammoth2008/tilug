## Identify

## 识别

In this chapter, you will learn about the first pillar of information literacy. While the pillars are normally presented in a certain order, it is important to remember that they are not in-tended to be a step-by-step guide to be followed in a strict order. In most research projects, you will find that you move back and forth between the different pillars as you discover more information and come up with more questions about your topic. In this chapter you will learn how to identify your information need so that you can begin your research, but it is likely that you will also revisit some of the ideas in this chapter to make sure you are actually meeting that need with your research findings.

在本章中，你将了解到信息素养的第一个支柱。虽然这些支柱通常是按照一定的顺序来介绍的，但重要的是要记住，它们并不是要按照严格的顺序来一步步指导你。在大多数研究项目中，你会发现，随着你发现更多的信息和提出更多关于你的主题的问题，你会在不同的支柱之间来回移动。在本章中，你将学习如何确定你的信息需求，以便开始你的研究，但你很可能还会重新审视本章中的一些观点，以确保你的研究结果确实满足了你的需求。

A person proficient in the Identify pillar is expected to be able to identify a personal need for information. They understand

一个精通 “识别 “支柱的人，应该能够识别个人对信息的需求。他们了解

That new information and data is constantly being produced and that there is always more to learn

### Scenario

### 场景

Norm Allknow was having trouble. He had been using computers since he was five years old and thought he knew all there was to know about them. So, when he was given an assignment to write about the impact of the Internet on society, he thought it would be a breeze. He would just write what he knew, and in no time the paper would be finished. In fact, Norm thought the paper would probably be much longer than the required ten pages. He spent a few minutes imagining how impressed his teacher was going to be, and then sat down to start writing.

Norm Allknow遇到了麻烦。他从五岁起就开始使用电脑，并认为他知道所有关于电脑的知识。因此，当他接到写关于互联网对社会的影响的任务时，他认为这将是一件轻而易举的事。他只需写下他所知道的东西，很快就能完成论文。事实上，诺姆认为这篇论文可能会比规定的10页长得多。他花了几分钟时间想象他的老师会有多大的印象，然后坐下来开始写。

He wrote about how the Internet had helped him to play online games with his friends, and to keep in touch with distant relatives, and even to do some homework once in a while. Soon he leaned back in his chair and looked over what he had written. It was just half a page long and he was out of ideas.

他写到互联网如何帮助他与朋友玩网络游戏，与远方的亲戚保持联系，甚至偶尔做一些家庭作业。不久，他靠在椅子上，翻看他写的东西。这篇文章只有半页长，他已经没有想法了。

#### Identifying a Personal Need for Information

#### 识别个人对信息的需求

One of the first things you need to do when beginning any information-based project is to identify your personal need for information. This may seem obvious, but it is something many of us take for granted. We may mistakenly assume, as Norm did in the above example, that we already know enough to proceed. Such an assumption can lead us to waste valuable time working with incomplete or outdated information. Information literacy addresses a number of abilities and concepts that can help us to determine exactly what our information needs are in various circumstances. These are discussed below, and are followed by exercises to help develop your fluency in this area.

在开始任何基于信息的项目时，你需要做的第一件事就是确定你个人对信息的需求。这看起来很明显，但我们中的许多人都认为这是理所当然的。我们可能会错误地认为，就像上面的例子中的Norm那样，我们已经知道了足够的信息，可以继续下去。这样的假设会导致我们浪费宝贵的时间去处理不完整或过时的信息。信息素养涉及一些能力和概念，可以帮助我们确定在各种情况下我们的信息需求。下文将讨论这些能力和概念，并附有练习，以帮助提高你在这一领域的流畅性。

#### Understanding the Context of an Information Need

#### 了解信息需求的背景

When you realize that you have an information need it may be because you thought you knew more than you actually do, or it may be that there is simply new information you were not aware of. One of the most important things you can do when starting to research a topic is to scan the existing information landscape to find out what is already out there. We’ll get into more specific strategies for accessing different types of information later in the book, particularly in the Gather chapter, but for now it pays to think more broadly about the information environment in which you are operating.

当你意识到你有信息需求时，可能是因为你认为你知道的比你实际知道的多，也可能只是有你不知道的新信息。当你开始研究一个主题时，你可以做的最重要的事情之一就是扫描现有的信息环境，找出已经存在的信息。我们将在本书后面，特别是在《集会》一章中讨论获取不同类型信息的具体策略，但现在要做的是，更广泛地思考你所处的信息环境。

For instance, any topic you need information about is constantly evolving as new information is added to what is known about the topic. Trained experts, informed amateurs, and opinionated laypeople are publishing in traditional and emerging formats; there is always something new to find out. The scale of information available varies according to topic, but in general it’s safe to say that there is more information accessible now than ever before.

例如，你需要了解的任何主题都在不断发展，因为新的信息被添加到关于该主题的已知内容中。训练有素的专家、消息灵通的业余爱好者和有主见的普通人都在以传统和新兴的形式发表文章；总是有新的东西可以发现。可用信息的规模因主题而异，但总的来说，可以说现在可以获得的信息比以往任何时候都多。

Due to the extensive amount of information available, part of becoming more information literate is developing habits of mind and of practice that enable you to continually seek new information and to adapt your understanding of topics according to what you find.

由于可获得的信息量很大，因此，提高信息素养的一部分是培养思维和实践的习惯，使你能够不断地寻找新的信息，并根据你的发现来调整你对主题的理解。

Because of the widely varying quality of new information, evaluation is also a key element of information literacy, and will be addressed in the Evaluate chapter of this book.

由于新信息的质量参差不齐，评估也是信息素养的一个关键因素，本书的 “评估 “一章将对此进行阐述。

Finally, while you are busy searching for information on your current topic, be sure to keep your mind open for new avenues or angles of research that you haven’t yet considered. Often the information you found for your initial need will turn out to be the pathway to a rich vein of information that can serve as raw material for many subsequent projects.

最后，当你忙于搜索关于你当前主题的信息时，一定要保持你的头脑开放，寻找你尚未考虑的新的研究途径或角度。通常情况下，你为最初的需要所找到的信息会变成通往丰富的信息脉络的途径，可以作为许多后续项目的原材料。

When you understand the information environment where your information need is situ-ated, you can begin to define the topic more clearly and you can begin to understand where your research fits in with related work that precedes it. Your information literacy skills will develop against this changing background as you use the same underlying principles to do research on a variety of topics.

当你了解了你的信息需求所处的信息环境后，你就可以开始更清楚地定义这个主题，你也可以开始了解你的研究与之前的相关工作的契合点。当你使用相同的基本原则对各种主题进行研究时，你的信息素养技能将在这种变化的背景下得到发展。

#### From Information Need to Research Question

#### 从信息需求到研究问题

Norm was abruptly confronted by his lack of knowledge when he realized that he had nothing left to say on his topic after writing half a page. Now that he is aware of that shortcoming, he can take steps to rectify it.

当诺姆意识到他在写了半页纸之后，对自己的主题已经无话可说时，他突然面临着自己的知识匮乏。现在他意识到了这个缺点，他可以采取措施来纠正它。

Your own lack of knowledge may become apparent in other ways. When reading an article or textbook, you may notice that something the author refers to is completely new to you. You might realize while out walking that you can’t identify any of the trees around your house. You may be assigned a topic you have never heard of.

你自己的知识匮乏可能在其他方面变得明显。当阅读一篇文章或教科书时，你可能会注意到作者提到的东西对你来说是完全陌生的。你可能会在外出散步时意识到，你无法识别你房子周围的任何树木。你可能会被分配一个你从未听说过的主题。

### Exercise: Identifying What You Don’t Know

### 练习：识别你不知道的东西

Wherever you are, look around you. Find one thing in your immediate field of view that you can’t explain.

无论你在哪里，看看你的周围。在你眼前的视野中找到一件你无法解释的事情。

What is it that you don’t understand about that thing?

你对那件事有什么不明白的地方？

What is it that you need to find out so that you can understand it? How can you express what you need to find out?

你需要找出什么，以便你能理解它？你如何表达你需要找到的东西？

For example: You can’t explain why your coat repels water. You know that it’s plastic, and that it’s designed to repel water, but can’t explain why this happens. You need to find out what kind of plastic the coat is made of and the chemistry or physics of that plastic and of water that makes the water run off instead of soaking through. (The terminology in your first explanation would get more specific once you did some research.)

比如说：你无法解释为什么你的外套会排斥水。你知道它是塑料的，而且它被设计成能排斥水，但不能解释为什么会这样。你需要找出外套是由哪种塑料制成的，以及该塑料和水的化学或物理特性，使水流走而不是浸透。(一旦你做了一些研究，你的第一个解释中的术语会变得更加具体）。

All of us lack knowledge in countless areas, but this isn’t a bad thing. Once we step back and acknowledge that we don’t know something, it opens up the possibility that we can find out all sorts of interesting things, and that’s when the searching begins.

我们所有人都在无数领域缺乏知识，但这并不是一件坏事。一旦我们退后一步，承认我们不知道的东西，就有可能发现各种有趣的东西，而这正是搜索的开始。

Taking your lack of knowledge and turning it into a search topic or research question starts with being able to state what your lack of knowledge is. Part of this is to state what you already know. It’s rare that you’ll start a search from absolute zero. Most of the time you’ve at least heard something about the topic, even if it is just a brief reference in a lecture or reading. Taking stock of what you already know can help you to identify any erroneous assumptions you might be making based on incomplete or biased information. If you think you know something, make sure you find at least a couple of reliable sources to confirm that knowledge before taking it for granted. Use the following exercise to see if there is anything that needs to be supported with background research before proceeding.

把你缺乏的知识变成一个搜索主题或研究问题，首先要能够说明你缺乏的知识是什么。这其中的一部分是说明你已经知道什么。你很少会从绝对的零开始进行搜索。大多数情况下，你至少听说过一些关于这个主题的事情，即使只是在讲座或阅读中简要提及。总结一下你已经知道的东西，可以帮助你找出你可能基于不完整或有偏见的信息而做出的任何错误假设。如果你认为你知道一些东西，确保你至少找到几个可靠的来源来证实这些知识，然后再想当然。利用下面的练习，看看是否有什么东西需要在进行背景研究之前得到支持。

### Exercise: Taking Stock of What You Already Know

### 练习：盘点你已经知道的东西

As discussed above, part of identifying your own information need is giving yourself credit for what you already know about your topic. Construct a chart using the following format to list whatever you already know about the topic.

如上所述，确定你自己的信息需求的一部分是为你自己已经知道的关于你的主题的东西给予肯定。使用下面的格式构建一个图表，列出你对该主题已经知道的东西。

Name your topic at the top.

在顶部命名你的主题。

In the first column, list what you know about your topic.

在第一栏，列出你对你的主题的了解。

In the second column, briefly explain how you know this (heard it from the professor, read it in the textbook, saw it on a blog, etc.).

在第二栏中，简要说明你是如何知道的（从教授那里听说的，在教科书上读到的，在博客上看到的，等等）。

In the last column, rate your confidence in that knowledge. Are you 100% sure of this bit of knowledge, or did you just hear it somewhere and assume it was right?

在最后一栏中，评价一下你对这些知识的信心。你对这一知识点有100%的把握，还是说你只是在某个地方听到，就认为它是正确的？

When you’ve looked at everything you think you know about the topic and why, step back and look at the chart as a whole. How much do you know about the topic, and how confident are you about it? You may be surprised at how little or how much you already know, but either way you will be aware of your own background on the topic. This self-awareness is key to becoming more information literate.

当你看完了所有你认为你知道的关于这个话题的内容和原因后，退后一步，把图表作为一个整体来看。你对这个题目知道多少，你对它有多大的信心？你可能会惊讶于自己知道的太少或太多，但无论如何，你都会意识到自己对这个话题的背景。这种自我意识是变得更有信息素养的关键。

This exercise gives you a simple way to gauge your starting point, and may help you identify specific gaps in your knowledge of your topic that you will need to fill as you proceed with your research. It can also be useful to revisit the chart as you work on your project to see how far you’ve progressed, as well as to double check that you haven’t forgotten an area of weakness.

这个练习为你提供了一个简单的方法来衡量你的起点，并可能帮助你确定你在研究过程中需要填补的关于你的主题的具体知识差距。在你开展项目的过程中重新审视这个图表，看看你已经取得了多大的进展，以及仔细检查你是否忘记了某个薄弱领域，这也是很有用的。

Once you’ve clearly stated what you do know, it should be easier to state what you don’t know. Keep in mind that you are not attempting to state everything you don’t know. You are only stating what you don’t know in terms of your current information need. This is where you define the limits of what you are searching for. These limits enable you to meet both size requirements and time deadlines for a project. If you state them clearly, they can help to keep you on track as you proceed with your research. You can learn more about this in the Scope chapter of this book.

一旦你清楚地说明了你所知道的事情，那么说明你不知道的事情就应该更容易了。请记住，你并不是要说明你不知道的一切。你只是根据你目前的信息需求来说明你不知道的东西。这是你定义你正在寻找的东西的限制。这些限制使你能够同时满足项目的规模要求和时间期限。如果你清楚地说明它们，它们可以帮助你在进行研究时保持正确的方向。你可以在本书的 “范围 “一章中了解更多这方面的信息。

One useful way to keep your research on track is with a “KWHL” chart. This type of chart enables you to state both what you know and what you want to know, as well as providing space where you can track your planning, searching and evaluation progress. For now, just fill out the first column, but start thinking about the gaps in your knowledge and how they might inform your research questions. You will learn more about developing these questions and the research activities that follow from them as you work through this book.

让你的研究保持正轨的一个有用方法是 “KWHL “图表。这种图表使你能够说明你知道什么和你想知道什么，并提供空间让你跟踪你的计划、搜索和评估进展。现在，你只需填写第一栏，但要开始考虑你的知识差距，以及它们如何为你的研究问题提供信息。当你阅读本书时，你会了解到更多关于制定这些问题以及由此产生的研究活动的信息。

Defining a research question can be more difficult than it seems. Your initial questions may be too broad or too narrow. You may not be familiar with specialized terminology used in the field you are researching. You may not know if your question is worth investigating at all.

确定一个研究问题可能比想象的要难。你最初的问题可能太广泛或太狭窄。你可能不熟悉你所研究的领域中使用的专业术语。你可能根本不知道你的问题是否值得调查。

These problems can often be solved by a preliminary investigation of existing published information on the topic. As previously discussed, gaining a general understanding of the information environment helps you to situate your information need in the relevant context and can also make you aware of possible alternative directions for your research. On a more practical note, however, reading through some of the existing information can also provide you with commonly used terminology, which you can then use to state your own research question, as well as in searches for additional information. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, but rely on the experts who have laid the groundwork for you to build upon.

这些问题通常可以通过初步调查有关该主题的现有公开信息来解决。如前所述，对信息环境有一个大致的了解，有助于你把你的信息需求放在相关的背景中，也可以让你意识到你的研究可能的替代方向。不过，从更实际的角度看，阅读一些现有的信息也可以为你提供常用的术语，然后你可以用这些术语来陈述你自己的研究问题，以及搜索其他信息。不要试图重新发明轮子，而是要依靠那些已经为你打下基础的专家。

Once you have identified your own lack of knowledge, investigated the existing information on the topic, and set some limits on your research based on your current information need, write out your research question or state your thesis. The next exercise will help you transform the question you have into an actual thesis statement. You’ll find that it’s not uncommon to revise your question or thesis statement several times in the course of a research project. As you become more and more knowledgeable about the topic, you will be able to state your ideas more clearly and precisely, until they almost perfectly reflect the information you have found.

一旦你发现自己的知识匮乏，调查了关于该主题的现有信息，并根据你目前的信息需求为你的研究设定了一些限制，就可以写出你的研究问题或陈述你的论文。接下来的练习将帮助你把你的问题转化为一个实际的论文陈述。你会发现，在一个研究项目的过程中，多次修改你的问题或论文陈述是很常见的。随着你对该主题的了解越来越多，你将能够更清楚、更准确地陈述你的想法，直到它们几乎完美地反映你所发现的信息。

### Exercise: Research Question/Thesis Statement/Search Terms

### 练习：研究问题/论文陈述/研究术语

Since this chapter is all about determining and expressing your information need, let’s follow up on thinking about that with a practical exercise. Follow these steps to get a better grasp of exactly what you are trying to find out, and to identify some initial search terms to get you started.

由于本章是关于确定和表达你的信息需求，让我们用一个实际的练习来跟进思考。按照这些步骤，我们可以更好地掌握你想要了解的确切内容，并确定一些初步的搜索条件，让你开始。

Whatever project you are currently working on, there should be some question you are trying to answer. Write your current version of that question here.

无论你目前正在做什么项目，都应该有一些你试图回答的问题。在这里写下你当前版本的这个问题。

Now write your proposed answer to your question. This may be the first draft of your thesis statement which you will attempt to support with your research, or in some cases, the first draft of a hypothesis that you will go on to test experi-mentally. It doesn’t have to be perfect at this point, but based on your current understanding of your topic and what you expect or hope to find is the answer to the question you asked.

现在写出你对问题的拟议答案。这可能是你的论文陈述的第一稿，你将试图用你的研究来支持它，或者在某些情况下，你将继续用经验来测试的假设的第一稿。在这一点上，它不一定是完美的，但要基于你目前对你的主题的理解，以及你期望或希望找到的是你所问问题的答案。

Look at your question and your thesis/hypothesis, and make a list of the terms common to both lists (excluding “the”, “and”, “a”, etc.). These common terms are likely the important concepts that you will need to research to support your thesis/hypothesis. They may be the most useful search terms overall or they may only be a starting point.

看看你的问题和你的论文/假设，并列出两份清单的共同术语（不包括 “the”、“and”、“a “等）。这些常见的术语可能是你需要研究的重要概念，以支持你的论文/假设。它们可能是总体上最有用的搜索术语，也可能只是一个起点。

If none of the terms from your question and thesis/hypothesis lists overlap at all, you might want to take a closer look and see if your thesis/hypothesis really answers your research question. If not, you may have arrived at your first opportunity for revision. Does your question really ask what you’re trying to find out? Does your proposed answer really answer that question? You may find that you need to change one or both, or to add something to one or both to really get at what you’re interested in. This is part of the process, and you will likely discover that as you gather more information about your topic, you will find other ways that you want to change your question or thesis to align with the facts, even if they are different from what you hoped.

如果你的问题清单和论文/假设清单中的术语完全没有重叠，你可能要仔细看看，看看你的论文/假设是否真正回答了你的研究问题。如果不是，你可能已经找到了第一个修改的机会。你的问题是否真的问出了你想知道的东西？你提出的答案是否真正回答了这个问题？你可能会发现，你需要改变其中一个或两个问题，或者在其中一个或两个问题上增加一些内容，以真正了解你所感兴趣的内容。这是过程的一部分，你很可能会发现，随着你收集更多关于你的主题的信息，你会发现你想改变你的问题或论文的其他方式，以符合事实，即使它们与你希望的不同。

### A Wider View

### 更广泛的观点

While the identification of an information need is presented in this chapter as the first step in the research process, many times the information need you initially identified will change as you discover new information and connections. Other chapters in this book deal with finding, evaluating, and managing information in a variety of ways and formats. As you become more skilled in using different information resources, you will likely find that the line between the various information literacy skills becomes increasingly blurred, and that you will revisit your initial ideas about your topic in response to both the information you’re finding and what you’re doing with what that information.

虽然本章将确定信息需求作为研究过程的第一步，但很多时候，你最初确定的信息需求会随着你发现新的信息和联系而改变。本书的其他章节涉及到以各种方式和格式寻找、评估和管理信息。随着你越来越熟练地使用不同的信息资源，你可能会发现各种信息素养技能之间的界限变得越来越模糊，而且你会根据你找到的信息和你对这些信息的处理情况，重新审视你对主题的最初想法。

Continually think about your relationship to the information you find. Why are you doing things the way you are? Is it really the best way for your current situation? What other options are there? Keeping an open mind about your use of information will help you to ensure that you take responsibility for the results of that use, and will help you to be more successful in any information-intensive endeavor.

不断思考你与你找到的信息的关系。你为什么要用你的方式做事？对于你目前的情况，这真的是最好的方式吗？还有什么其他选择？对信息的使用保持开放的心态，将有助于你确保对使用的结果负责，并将帮助你在任何信息密集型的工作中获得更大的成功。
