## 鉴定

In this chapter, you will learn about the first pillar of information literacy. While the pillars are normally presented in a certain order, it is important to remember that they are not in- tended to be a step-by-step guide to be followed in a strict order. In most research projects, you will find that you move back and forth between the different pillars as you discover more information and come up with more questions about your topic. In this chapter you will learn how to identify your information need so that you can begin your research, but it is likely that you will also revisit some of the ideas in this chapter to make sure you are actually meeting that need with your research findings.

在本章中，您将学习到信息素养的第一个支柱。虽然这些支柱通常按照一定顺序呈现，但重要的是要记住它们并不是要按照严格的顺序进行步骤指南。在大多数研究项目中，你会发现在发现更多信息和对你的主题提出更多问题时，你会在不同的支柱之间来回移动。在本章中，您将学习如何确定您的信息需求，以便开始研究，但很可能您还会重新审查本章中的一些想法，以确保您实际上是通过研究结果满足了需求。

A person proficient in the Identify pillar is expected to be able to identify a personal need for information. They understand

掌握“识别”支柱的人应当能够识别个人信息需求。他们理解信息的不同来源，并能够选择正确的来源来满足需求。

### Scenario

### 场景

Norm Allknow was having trouble. He had been using computers since he was five years old and thought he knew all there was to know about them. So, when he was given an assignment to write about the impact of the Internet on society, he thought it would be a breeze. He would just write what he knew, and in no time the paper would be finished. In fact, Norm thought the paper would probably be much longer than the required ten pages. He spent a few minutes imagining how impressed his teacher was going to be, and then sat down to start writing.

诺姆·奥尔诺遇到了麻烦。自从他5岁起就一直在使用电脑，认为自己已经了解了所有的知识。所以，当他被分配写一篇关于互联网对社会的影响的论文时，他认为这将是一件轻松的事情。他只需写出他所知道的，很快就可以完成论文。事实上，诺姆认为这篇论文可能会比所需的十页更长。他花了几分钟想象他的老师会对他的论文赞不绝口，然后坐下来开始写作。

He wrote about how the Internet had helped him to play online games with his friends, and to keep in touch with distant relatives, and even to do some homework once in a while. Soon he leaned back in his chair and looked over what he had written. It was just half a page long and he was out of ideas.

他写道互联网如何帮助他与朋友玩在线游戏，与远房亲戚保持联系，甚至有时完成一些作业。不久他靠在椅子上，看着他所写的内容。只有半页纸，他已经没有思路了。

#### Identifying a Personal Need for Information

#### 确定个人信息需求

One of the first things you need to do when beginning any information-based project is to identify your personal need for information. This may seem obvious, but it is something many of us take for granted. We may mistakenly assume, as Norm did in the above example, that we already know enough to proceed. Such an assumption can lead us to waste valuable time working with incomplete or outdated information. Information literacy addresses a number of abilities and concepts that can help us to determine exactly what our informa- tion needs are in various circumstances. These are discussed below, and are followed by exercises to help develop your fluency in this area.

开始任何基于信息的项目时，你需要做的第一件事就是确定你个人对信息的需求。这似乎是显而易见的，但很多人却忽视了它。我们可能错误地假设，就像上面的诺姆一样，我们已经知道足够的信息来进行下一步工作了。这样的假设可能会使我们花费宝贵的时间去处理不完整或过时的信息。信息素养涵盖了许多能力和概念，可以帮助我们确定各种情况下我们对信息的确切需求。下面将对这些进行讨论，并提供练习，帮助你发展这方面的流利程度。

#### Understanding the Context of an Information Need

#### 理解信息需求背景 当我们需要某些信息时，我们经常需要考虑该信息的背景。这是为了更好地理解我们的需求，并在信息资源中找到所需的内容。了解信息需求的背景可以帮助我们识别信息来源，了解信息的内容和可靠性，并帮助我们更好地规划我们的研究和搜索策略。 信息需求的背景可以包括以下方面： 1.主题：信息的主题是我们需要了解的一个具体主题。它应该被清晰地定义，并以问句的形式表达。 2.目的：我们需要考虑信息的目的和需要。是我们为了学术研究，解决某个问题或获取娱乐信息？ 3.用户：信息需求的用户通常是我们自己或我们的客户。我们需要考虑用户背景，需求和能力，以便找到适当的信息资源。 4.时间：我们需要确定我们需要的信息时间范围。例如，我们需要了解一个历史事件的背景，需要知道特定时间段内发生的事件。 了解信息需求的背景是更有效地搜索和使用信息的关键。在我们开始搜索信息之前，应该考虑和理解我们的需求背景。

When you realize that you have an information need it may be because you thought you knew more than you actually do, or it may be that there is simply new information you were not aware of. One of the most important things you can do when starting to research a topic is to scan the existing information landscape to find out what is already out there. We’ll get into more specific strategies for accessing different types of information later in the book, particularly in the Gather chapter, but for now it pays to think more broadly about the information environment in which you are operating.

当你意识到自己有信息需求时，可能是因为你认为自己知道的比实际更多，或者可能只是因为有新的信息你不知道而已。当你开始研究一个话题时，最重要的事情之一就是扫描现有的信息景观，了解已经存在的内容。在本书的后面章节中，特别是在“收集”章节中，我们将介绍不同类型信息获取的更具体的策略，但现在最好还是更加广泛地考虑你操作的信息环境。

For instance, any topic you need information about is constantly evolving as new informa- tion is added to what is known about the topic. Trained experts, informed amateurs, and opinionated laypeople are publishing in traditional and emerging formats; there is always something new to find out. The scale of information available varies according to topic, but in general it’s safe to say that there is more information accessible now than ever before.

例如，您需要了解的任何主题都在不断发展，因为新的信息正在被添加到已知的主题中。受过训练的专家、知情的业余爱好者和有意见的普通人都在传统和新兴的格式中发布内容；总有新的东西可以发现。可获得的信息规模因主题而异，但总的来说可以说现在可获取的信息比以往任何时候都要多。

Due to the extensive amount of information available, part of becoming more information literate is developing habits of mind and of practice that enable you to continually seek new information and to adapt your understanding of topics according to what you find.

由于可用的信息大量涌现，成为信息素养的一部分就是培养适应性，不断寻找新信息并根据所找到的内容调整对主题的理解的思维习惯和实践方法。

Because of the widely varying quality of new information, evaluation is also a key element of information literacy, and will be addressed in the Evaluate chapter of this book.

由于新信息的质量各不相同，评估也是信息素养的关键要素，将在本书的《评估》一章中介绍。

Finally, while you are busy searching for information on your current topic, be sure to keep your mind open for new avenues or angles of research that you haven’t yet considered. Often the information you found for your initial need will turn out to be the pathway to a rich vein of information that can serve as raw material for many subsequent projects.

最后，在您忙于搜索当前主题的信息时，请确保开放您的思想，以寻找您尚未考虑过的新的研究途径或角度。通常，您为初始需求找到的信息将变成丰富信息的门径，可作为许多后续项目的原始材料。

When you understand the information environment where your information need is situ- ated, you can begin to define the topic more clearly and you can begin to understand where your research fits in with related work that precedes it. Your information literacy skills will develop against this changing background as you use the same underlying principles to do research on a variety of topics.

当您了解所需信息所处的信息环境时，您可以开始更清晰地定义主题，并开始了解您的研究与之前相关工作的关系。随着您使用相同的基本原则在各种主题上进行研究，您的信息素养技能将随着这种变化而发展。

#### From Information Need to Research Question

#### 从信息需求到研究问题

Norm was abruptly confronted by his lack of knowledge when he realized that he had nothing left to say on his topic after writing half a page. Now that he is aware of that shortcoming, he can take steps to rectify it.

诺姆在写了半页纸之后意识到自己对主题的了解不足，因此突然面临知识缺乏的问题。现在他意识到了这一缺点，可以采取措施加以改善。

Your own lack of knowledge may become apparent in other ways. When reading an article or textbook, you may notice that something the author refers to is completely new to you. You might realize while out walking that you can’t identify any of the trees around your house. You may be assigned a topic you have never heard of.

您自己的知识不足可能在其他方面变得明显。当阅读文章或教科书时，您可能会注意到作者提到的某些内容对您来说是全新的。当您在散步时意识到自己无法识别房子周围的任何树木时，您可能会意识到。您可能会被分配一项您从未听说过的主题。

### Exercise: Identifying What You Don’t Know

### 练习：识别你不知道的知识

Wherever you are, look around you. Find one thing in your immediate field of view that you can’t explain.

无论你身在何处，看看周围。 找到你眼前的一个东西，无法解释。

What is it that you don’t understand about that thing?

你不明白那件事情的哪一部分？

What is it that you need to find out so that you can understand it? How can you express what you need to find out?

你需要找到什么才能理解它？你该如何表达自己需要了解的内容？

For example: You can’t explain why your coat repels water. You know that it’s plastic, and that it’s designed to repel water, but can’t explain why this happens. You need to find out what kind of plastic the coat is made of and the chemistry or physics of that plastic and of water that makes the water run off instead of soaking through. (The terminology in your first explanation would get more specific once you did some research.)

例如：你无法解释为什么你的外套可以防水。你知道它是塑料制成的，并且它被设计成能够防水，但无法解释这是为什么。你需要找出这件外套是用哪种塑料制成的，以及这种塑料和水的化学或物理性质，使得水能够流过而不是渗透。 （一旦进行了一些研究，你的第一个解释中的术语将变得更加具体。）

All of us lack knowledge in countless areas, but this isn’t a bad thing. Once we step back and acknowledge that we don’t know something, it opens up the possibility that we can find out all sorts of interesting things, and that’s when the searching begins.

我们所有人在无数领域都缺乏知识，但这并不是坏事。一旦我们退一步承认自己不知道某件事，就会打开我们可以发现有趣事物的可能性，这就是搜索开始的时刻。

Taking your lack of knowledge and turning it into a search topic or research question starts with being able to state what your lack of knowledge is. Part of this is to state what you already know. It’s rare that you’ll start a search from absolute zero. Most of the time you’ve at least heard something about the topic, even if it is just a brief reference in a lecture or reading. Taking stock of what you already know can help you to identify any erroneous assumptions you might be making based on incomplete or biased information. If you think you know something, make sure you find at least a couple of reliable sources to confirm that knowledge before taking it for granted. Use the following exercise to see if there is anything that needs to be supported with background research before proceeding.

将您的缺乏知识转化为搜索主题或研究问题始于能够说明您的缺乏知识。其中一部分是说明您已经知道的内容。通常您不会从零开始搜索。大多数时候，您至少听说过该主题，即使只是在讲座或阅读中的简要参考。了解您已知的信息可以帮助您识别可能由于不完整或有偏见的信息而产生的任何错误假设。如果您认为您知道某些信息，请确保在采纳该信息之前找到至少两个可靠的来源来确认该知识。使用以下练习来查看是否需要在继续之前支持任何背景研究。

### Exercise: Taking Stock of What You Already Know

### 练习：盘点你已经知道的内容

As discussed above, part of identifying your own information need is giving yourself credit for what you already know about your topic. Construct a chart using the fol- lowing format to list whatever you already know about the topic.

正如上文所讨论的那样，确定自己的信息需求的一部分是要为自己已经知道的主题内容给予信任。使用以下格式构建一个表格，列出您已经了解的关于该主题的任何信息。

Name your topic at the top.

在顶部命名您的主题。

In the first column, list what you know about your topic.

在第一栏中，列出关于你的主题所知道的事情。

In the second column, briefly explain how you know this (heard it from the professor, read it in the textbook, saw it on a blog, etc.).

第二列，简要说明你如何知道这一点（从教授那里听到，从教科书上读到，从博客上看到等）。

In the last column, rate your confidence in that knowledge. Are you 100% sure of this bit of knowledge, or did you just hear it somewhere and assume it was right?

在最后一列中，评价你对这项知识的自信程度。你对这一知识是否100%确定，或者只是听说过，并假定它是正确的？

When you’ve looked at everything you think you know about the topic and why, step back and look at the chart as a whole. How much do you know about the topic, and how confident are you about it? You may be surprised at how little or how much you already know, but either way you will be aware of your own background on the topic. This self-awareness is key to becoming more information literate.

当您已经观察了您所认为的有关该主题的一切以及原因时，请后退并全面考虑该图表。您对该主题了解到多少，您的信心有多大？您可能会惊讶地发现自己已经了解得很少或很多，但无论哪种方式，您都将意识到自己在该主题上的背景。这种自我意识是成为更加信息有素的关键。

This exercise gives you a simple way to gauge your starting point, and may help you identify specific gaps in your knowledge of your topic that you will need to fill as you proceed with your research. It can also be useful to revisit the chart as you work on your project to see how far you’ve progressed, as well as to double check that you haven’t forgotten an area of weakness.

这项练习为您提供了一个简单的方法来衡量您的起点，并可能帮助您识别主题知识中的特定空缺，这将需要您在进行研究时填补。随着您进行项目工作，回顾这张表也很有用，以查看您已经前进了多少，以及仔细检查是否忘记了某个弱点领域。

Once you've clearly stated what you do know, it should be easier to state what you don’t know. Keep in mind that you are not attempting to state everything you don’t know. You are only stating what you don’t know in terms of your current information need. This is where you define the limits of what you are searching for. These limits enable you to meet both size requirements and time deadlines for a project. If you state them clearly, they can help to keep you on track as you proceed with your research. You can learn more about this in the Scope chapter of this book.

一旦您清楚地阐述了您所知道的，就更容易说明您不知道的内容。请记住，您不试图说明您不知道的所有内容，您只是在当前信息需求方面表明您不知道的内容。这就是您定义要搜索的范围的地方。这些限制可以使您满足项目的大小要求和时间要求。如果您清楚地说明它们，它们可以帮助您在进行研究时保持在正确的轨道上。您可以在本书的范围章节中了解更多信息。

One useful way to keep your research on track is with a “KWHL” chart. This type of chart enables you to state both what you know and what you want to know, as well as providing space where you can track your planning, searching and evaluation progress. For now, just fill out the first column, but start thinking about the gaps in your knowledge and how they might inform your research questions. You will learn more about developing these questions and the research activities that follow from them as you work through this book.

保持研究进展顺利的一种有用方式是使用“KWHL”图表。这种类型的图表使您能够陈述您所知道的和您想知道的，同时提供空间，让您可以追踪您的规划、搜索和评估进度。现在，只需填写第一列，但开始思考您的知识差距以及它们如何影响您的研究问题。随着您通过本书工作，您将了解更多关于如何开发这些问题和随之而来的研究活动。

Defining a research question can be more difficult than it seems. Your initial questions may be too broad or too narrow. You may not be familiar with specialized terminology used in the field you are researching. You may not know if your question is worth investigating at all.

定义研究问题可能比看上去更困难。你最初的问题可能太广泛或太狭窄。你可能不熟悉你正在研究的领域使用的专业术语。你可能不知道你的问题是否值得调查。

These problems can often be solved by a preliminary investigation of existing published information on the topic. As previously discussed, gaining a general understanding of the information environment helps you to situate your information need in the relevant context and can also make you aware of possible alternative directions for your research. On a more practical note, however, reading through some of the existing information can also provide you with commonly used terminology, which you can then use to state your own research question, as well as in searches for additional information. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, but rely on the experts who have laid the groundwork for you to build upon.

这些问题通常可以通过对该主题现有的已发表信息进行初步调查来解决。 正如先前讨论的那样，了解信息环境可以帮助您将信息需求放置在相关的上下文中，还可以让您意识到可能的其他研究方向。 然而，在更实际的层面上，阅读一些现有信息也可以为您提供常用术语，您可以使用这些术语来陈述自己的研究问题，并在搜索其他信息时使用。 不要尝试重复发明轮子，而是依靠已为您铺好基础的专家。

Once you have identified your own lack of knowledge, investigated the existing informa- tion on the topic, and set some limits on your research based on your current information need, write out your research question or state your thesis. The next exercise will help you transform the question you have into an actual thesis statement. You’ll find that it’s not uncommon to revise your question or thesis statement several times in the course of a research project. As you become more and more knowledgeable about the topic, you will be able to state your ideas more clearly and precisely, until they almost perfectly reflect the information you have found.

一旦您确定了自己缺乏的知识，并调查了关于该主题的现有信息，并根据当前信息需求设定了一些限制，请写出您的研究问题或陈述您的论文。下一个练习将帮助您将您的问题转化为实际的论文陈述。您会发现，在研究项目中多次修改您的问题或论文陈述并不罕见。随着您对主题的了解越来越深入，您将能够更清晰、更准确地陈述您的想法，直到它们几乎完美地反映了您所发现的信息。

### Exercise: Research Question/Thesis Statement/Search Terms

### 练习：研究问题/论文陈述/搜索术语

Since this chapter is all about determining and expressing your information need, let’s follow up on thinking about that with a practical exercise. Follow these steps to get a better grasp of exactly what you are trying to find out, and to identify some initial search terms to get you started.

既然本章是关于确定和表达您的信息需求，让我们跟进以实践演习思考。按照以下步骤更好地掌握您想要了解的信息，并确定一些起始搜索词来帮助您开始。

1. Whatever project you are currently working on, there should be some question you are trying to answer. Write your current version of that question here.
2. 无论您目前正在进行的任何项目是什么，都应该有一些问题需要您去回答。请在此处编写您目前版本的问题。
3. Now write your proposed answer to your question. This may be the first draft of your thesis statement which you will attempt to support with your research, or in some cases, the first draft of a hypothesis that you will go on to test experi- mentally. It doesn’t have to be perfect at this point, but based on your current understanding of your topic and what you expect or hope to find is the answer to the question you asked.
4. 现在写下你对问题的建议答案。这可能是你尝试用研究支持的论文陈述的初稿，或在某些情况下，你将继续进行实验测试的假设的初稿。这一点并不需要完美，但是基于你对话题的当前理解以及你期望或希望找到的答案，这是你提出的问题的答案。
5. Look at your question and your thesis/hypothesis, and make a list of the terms common to both lists (excluding “the”, “and”, “a”, etc.). These common terms are likely the important concepts that you will need to research to support your thesis/hypothesis. They may be the most useful search terms overall or they may only be a starting point.
6. 看看你的问题和论点/假设，列出两个列表都有的术语（排除“the”、“and”、“a”等）。这些共同的术语可能是你需要研究支持你的论点/假设的重要概念。它们可能是最有用的搜索术语，也可能只是一个起点。

If none of the terms from your question and thesis/hypothesis lists overlap at all, you might want to take a closer look and see if your thesis/hypothesis really answers your research question. If not, you may have arrived at your first opportunity for revision. Does your question really ask what you’re trying to find out? Does your proposed answer really answer that question? You may find that you need to change one or both, or to add something to one or both to really get at what you’re interested in. This is part of the process, and you will likely discover that as you gather more information about your topic, you will find other ways that you want to change your question or thesis to align with the facts, even if they are different from what you hoped.

如果你的问题列表和论文/假设列表中没有任何一个术语重叠，你可能需要仔细检查一下，看看你的论文/假设是否真正回答了你的研究问题。如果不是，你可能已经到达了第一个修订机会。你的问题是否真的问到了你想要找出的内容？你的提出的答案是否真的回答了那个问题？你可能会发现，你需要改变其中一个或两个，或者在其中一个或两个中添加一些东西，才能真正了解你感兴趣的内容。这是过程的一部分，你可能会发现，随着你收集更多关于你的话题的信息，即使它们与你希望的不同，你也会找到其他想要改变你的问题或论文的方法，以使其与事实相符。

### A Wider View

### 一个更广阔的视野

While the identification of an information need is presented in this chapter as the first step in the research process, many times the information need you initially identified will change as you discover new information and connections. Other chapters in this book deal with finding, evaluating, and managing information in a variety of ways and formats. As you become more skilled in using different information resources, you will likely find that the line between the various information literacy skills becomes increasingly blurred, and that you will revisit your initial ideas about your topic in response to both the information you’re finding and what you’re doing with what that information.

虽然在本章中将信息需求的识别作为研究过程的第一步，但往往您最初识别的信息需求会随着发现新信息和联系而改变。本书的其他章节介绍了以各种方式和形式找到、评估和管理信息的方法。随着您越来越熟练地使用不同的信息资源，您可能会发现各种信息素养技能之间的界限变得越来越模糊，并且您将重新审视有关主题的初步想法，以回应您发现的信息和您正在处理的信息。

Continually think about your relationship to the information you find. Why are you doing things the way you are? Is it really the best way for your current situation? What other options are there? Keeping an open mind about your use of information will help you to ensure that you take responsibility for the results of that use, and will help you to be more successful in any information-intensive endeavor.

持续思考你与所发现信息的关系。你为什么会以目前的方式做事？这真的是你目前情况中最好的方式吗？还有其他选项吗？保持对信息使用的开放态度将有助于确保你对其使用结果负责，并有助于在任何信息密集型的项目中获得更多成功。
